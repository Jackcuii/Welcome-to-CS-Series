# Welcome-to-CS-Series
A series of 3 lectures for beginners in Computer Science, including the following ones:  
Up to now, this series is designed by me, but I will refine it in the future, and ask some guests to supplement it.  
1. Computer Science from a High School Student's Aspect. \[Open Source\]  
2. Dreamer from beginning - Computer Science Spiritï¼Œ Today and Personal Development \[Open Source\]  
3. Fly, B***h \[Not Fully Open Source\] (This content contains some aggressive, unfriendly truth of the school. If you want to get this resource (as a freshman or serving as a peer tutor), please contact me (email), showing your education ID and telling me why.  


**This series' policy**:  
```
if you serve as a peer tutor:   
  if you attend the _distinguished peer-tutor selection_:   
    you must make contribution to this repo **or** offer your students list for checking your duty **before** you use this project   
    otherwise it is regarded as  
  else:   
    feel free to use it!   
elif you are a student:   
  feel free to refer to it!   
   
You should not spread Part3 in any situation.   
```

Personally, I will not attend the _distinguished peer-tutor selection_ or something like this.   
I make this policy just to avoid it being utilized by some only-talk-no-act, lazy, bureaucratic student cadres, who are annoying and quite common in the university.  
I take this job because I wish I had had a kind peer tutor to give some useful info in my first year at university. So I do not want this repo to be abused.
